  <b>Introduction</b>
  <Text>
    The project collaborates with researcher Lidwine Spoormans, translating the research data into an interactive art installation. 
    
    The research [Spoormans et al., 2023] focuses on the stakeholder differentiation in evaluating the heritage significance of neighbourhood attributes, helping reduce the knowledge gap on how stakeholders, individuals and groups, convey significance to their living environment, in their similarities and differences.
    <br />
    <br />
    Through viewing from different lenses, participants immerse themselves in experiencing the changes on neighbourhood scene brought about by different perspectives of stakeholders.
    <br />
    <br />
    The imaginative neighbourhood are generated by{" "}
