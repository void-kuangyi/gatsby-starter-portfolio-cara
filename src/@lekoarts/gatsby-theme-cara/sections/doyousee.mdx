  <b>Introduction</b>
  <Text>
    The project collaborates with researcher Lidwine Spoormans, translating the
    research data into an interactive art installation. The research [Spoormans
    et al., 2023] focuses on the stakeholder differentiation in evaluating the
    heritage significance of neighbourhood attributes, helping reduce the
    knowledge gap on how stakeholders, individuals and groups, convey
    significance to their living environment, in their similarities and
    differences.
    <br />
    <br />
    Through viewing from different lenses, participants immerse themselves in experiencing
    the changes on neighbourhood scene brought about by different perspectives of
    stakeholders.
    <br />
    <br />
    The imaginative neighbourhood are generated by{" "}
    <a href="https://www.midjourney.com/explore">Midjourney</a>, inspired by
    Lombok, Utrecht. Elements are extracted from the AI-generated images to
    construct a neighbourhood scene. The illustration then gets turned into a
    lithophane. The neighbourhood data will be represented by the light
    intensity and its location.
