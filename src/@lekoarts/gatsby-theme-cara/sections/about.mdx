    I work in the intersection of <b>play, social inclusion, and data</b>.{" "}
    <br /> <br />
    My work often use playfulness, contrast, interaction and data, to present different perspectives, to challenge stereotypes and preconceptions, and open up spaces for nuances. I advocate for storytelling from first person perspective and plural narration. Instead of “design for others”, I design as others. 
    <br /> <br />
    Personally, I am quirky, queer, playful, logical, and multicultured.
    <br /> <br />I am open to new opportunities, whether in full-time roles, freelance
    projects, or collaborations. Feel free to <a href="/contact">
